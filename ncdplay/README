           ncdplay - an ncurses implementation of a cdplayer
           =================================================

Why?
====

The reason why I decided to make ncdplay was simple, the only decent command
line cd player at the time was. Well, I couldn't find any that were decent,
enough to even be considered `decent'; Most of them just flat out sucked, so
I was left with a few choices. One choice, was to deal with it; personally I
dont like having to deal with things if it is in my power to change them. Opt-
ion two, was deal with the X cd players, while this worked fine for good major-
ity of the time, some of the better X cd players sometimes gave me trouble, for
this reason, I chose option number three. Which of course was to create my own
console cd player.
