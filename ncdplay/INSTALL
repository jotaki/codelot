just run:
	gunzip -c ncdplay-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	cd ncdplay-<version>
	make
	su -c 'make install'

if you have any problems you can either email me (zer0python(at)gmail(dot)com),
or contact me on IRC, on irc.freenode.net, channel #peltkore.

	The default install location is /usr/local/bin, and the manpage is
/usr/local/share/man, you can change this by editing the Makefile's in src/,
and doc/
