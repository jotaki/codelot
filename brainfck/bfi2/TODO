FIXME:
  segfault when pressing ']' without mathing '['.

FEATURE:
  thread machine and cleanup input/output between machine and cli/gui
    |_> maybe add a codefd pipe to write brainfuck to.

  helper keymappings:
    https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_algorithms#x_.3D_x_.2F_y

  input mode for writing brainfuck directly?

  hex view of code?

  resizable "windows" ?

OPTIMIZATIONS:
  optimizations can be made in brainfuck_compile when dealing with loops.
  store repeat count of operators and use repeat counts as increment values.

  cli/gui code can be cleaned up (probably)

CHANGEME:
  use machinep->ops[] instead of ifacep->code for showing code.
  move some stuff in showhelp() to its own helper function.
  update alert() to show a window like showhelp(). (use alert() in more places)

CODECHANGE:
  use a viewport buffer? -- (standardize to be reusable?)
  hardcoded values should be #define's (probably)
