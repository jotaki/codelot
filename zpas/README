This isn't an actual full assembler yet, infact it still has ways to go before
it can even be compared to some of the crappier assemblers out there. the fol-
lowing opcodes have been implemented:

	AAA
	AAD
	AAM
	AAS

	CLC
	CLD
	CLI
	CLTS
	CMC
	CPUID

	HLT

	INT
	INT3
	INTO

	MOV	- only a few opcodes from mov.

	NOP

some assembler specific stuff:

	#define - define some constants.
	#undef  - un-define them

TODO:
	This list is huge, there is still about 100's of more opcodes that need to be
implmented along with data handling (ie: variables), other than that this
assembler should be able to make a simple bootloader. (right now you will need
to make the size 510 bytes + 0xAA55 it manually.) Well that's it, if you would
like to contribute to this project email me at zer0python(at)yahoo.com or get
a hold of me on irc.freenode.net, #peltkore. Bug reports welcome! :)
